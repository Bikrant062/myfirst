        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p class="one">
            Data is the raw fact about anything which is unprocessed, un-interpreted or unorganized, but able to organize into useful information. For Example: Hari, Manager, Pokhara, 5 etc.Data is a collection of raw information. Here in DBMS system data is specially used for the further process we are trying to do. 
            Specially for the managemnent of those data by using DBMS as a initial inforamtion data is used.
        </p><hr>
        <h3>Information</h3>
        <p class="one">
            When raw data is processed and changed it into meaning data, then the meaningful data is called information. Information is processed, interpreted or organized data.
            For Example: Ram, Student of MMC, Manager of Mega Bank, etc.
        </p><hr>
        <h3>Meta Data</h3>
        <p class="one">
            Metadata is data that provides information about other data. It includes details such as data type, format, structure, and origin, helping in understanding and managing data effectively. Metadata is crucial for data retrieval, integration, and usage as it enables users to comprehend the context and attributes of the data they are working with.
        </p><hr>
        <h3>Data Dictionary</h3>
        <p class="one">
            A data dictionary is a centralized repository that stores definitions and descriptions of data elements within a database or information system. It includes information about the structure, constraints, and relationships of the data. Data dictionaries are essential for ensuring consistency, data integrity, and clarity in data management by providing a clear reference for developers and users.
        </p><hr>
        <h3>Database</h3>
        <p class="one">
            A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are managed by database management systems (DBMS) and allow for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. They are widely used in various applications, from simple data storage to complex enterprise systems, to ensure data consistency and accessibility.
        </p><hr>
        <h3>Table</h3>
        <p class="one">
            A table is a collection of related data entries in a database, organized in rows and columns. Each column represents a specific attribute, while each row (or record) represents a single entity's data. Tables are fundamental components of relational databases, enabling structured storage and easy retrieval of data through SQL queries.
        </p><hr>
        <h3>Tuple</h3>
        <p class="one">
            A tuple is a single row or record in a table within a database, representing a single data item. It consists of a set of attribute values, one for each column in the table. Tuples are unique in their context, typically identified by a key attribute, and are used to store individual records in a relational database.
        </p><hr>
        <h3>Domain</h3>
        <p class="one">
            A domain refers to the set of permissible values that a given attribute can take in a database. It defines the data type, range, and constraints for the attribute, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Domains help maintain valid data by restricting entries to acceptable values, thereby preventing errors and inconsistencies.
        </p><hr>
        <h3>Key</h3>
        <p class="one">
            A key is an attribute or a set of attributes used to uniquely identify a tuple in a table. Keys ensure that each record in a table can be uniquely distinguished from others. Primary keys uniquely identify each record, while foreign keys establish relationships between tables, enabling the linking of data across different tables in a relational database.
